/*
==  INTERFACE  ==
1) An interface in java is a blueprint of a class
2) interface contains final and static variables
3) interface contains abstract methods
4) Abstract method contains only definition but not body
5) methods in interface are public by default
6) interface supports functionality of multiple inheritance
7) we can define interface with interface keyword
8) class extends another class and interface extends another interface but class impliments interface
9) we can create object referance for interface but cannot instantiate interface

in class - class A{
	        variables
			methods

			}
in interface - interface A{
				variables are static and final
				methods are abstract
		}
normal method -- void m1(parameters){
				body of method
						}	
						
abstract method--void m1(parameters);

point 9 - we can create reference -          class c; 
but cannot instantiate -                 	 interface i = new interface();
to instantiate we need to refer class -      interface i = new classname();
